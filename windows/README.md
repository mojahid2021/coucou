# Coucou for Windows

**Mochi doesn't get a notch on a PC — so it lives at the top of your screen instead.**

Approve Claude Code permissions, watch your session work, drop a file, chat with Claude, keep an eye on your services — without leaving what you're doing.

## Install

The downloadable installer is **temporarily unavailable**. Microsoft Defender
wrongly flags the unsigned installer as malware (`Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.H!ml`, a
machine-learning false positive). A report is under review at Microsoft, and the
installer will be published again once it is cleared and code-signed.

Until then, [build it yourself](#build-it-yourself): it takes a few minutes and
installs for the current user only — no admin prompt.

## Using it

<img src="screenshots/overview.png" width="640" alt="The overview: the focused integration on the left, the other pills on the right">
<img src="screenshots/approval.png" width="640" alt="A Claude Code permission request, with Deny and Allow">

<img src="screenshots/drop.png" width="640" alt="Mochi turned into a box, waiting for a file">

| What you do | What happens |
|---|---|
| Move the mouse to the very top-centre of the screen | Mochi peeks out |
| Click the small island | It opens |
| Click Mochi | It gets annoyed. Three times in a row and it goes dizzy |
| Rest the pointer on Mochi for two seconds | Hearts |
| Drag a file onto the island | Mochi turns into a box, swallows it, then offers to answer questions about it |
| `Esc` | Closes the island |
| Tray icon | Open, Settings…, Pause, Quit |

Everything else happens on its own: a Claude Code permission request opens the
island with **Deny / Allow**, a finished session shows what it did, and
your integrations sit in the coloured pills next to Mochi.

## Claude Code

<img src="screenshots/settings.png" width="562" alt="The settings window">

Open **Settings… → Claude Code → Install hooks…**. You get the exact diff of what
will change in `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json`, the path of the dated backup
that will be taken, and nothing is written until you click. Your own hooks are
never touched, and uninstalling removes only Coucou's entries.

The relay is a tiny executable, `coucou-hook.exe`, copied to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Coucou\bin\` at launch. It is given 300 ms to reach Coucou and
exits cleanly if the app is closed, slow or crashed — **a Claude Code session is
never blocked or slowed down by Coucou.** If nobody answers a permission request
in time, Coucou stays quiet and Claude Code asks in the terminal as usual.

It works from any terminal — Windows Terminal, PowerShell, VS Code, Git Bash.

## GitHub Copilot

<img src="screenshots/settings.png" width="562" alt="The settings window">

**Settings… → GitHub Copilot → Install hooks…** writes a single file,
`%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\hooks\coucou.json`, and one file covers three surfaces:

| Surface | Why the same file works |
|---|---|
| Copilot CLI | `~/.copilot/hooks/*.json` is its native user-level hook directory |
| VS Code — Local harness | Discovers `~/.copilot/hooks/*.json` and accepts the Copilot format |
| VS Code — Copilot target | Runs the same Copilot SDK as the CLI |

Copilot sessions get their own `agent_copilot` pill, next to Claude Code, and
permission requests raise a normal Allow / Deny card. As with Claude Code you get
the exact diff first, a dated backup is taken, your own Copilot hooks are never
touched, and uninstalling removes only Coucou's entries.

Copilot reads `stdout` from a permission hook as the decision itself, so the relay
writes `{"behavior":"allow"}` for Copilot and Claude Code's `hookSpecificOutput`
envelope for everyone else. **Always** is hidden for Copilot, which has no
equivalent of Claude Code's `updatedPermissions`.

Approvals deliberately ride Copilot's `permissionRequest` hook rather than
`preToolUse`: Copilot treats a crashing or non-zero-exit `preToolUse` hook as a
**deny**, so a Coucou bug would break your tool calls. `permissionRequest` is
fail-open, which means a Coucou that is closed or slow simply leaves Copilot to
ask in its own terminal.

If `COPILOT_HOME` is set, Coucou writes to `$COPILOT_HOME/hooks/coucou.json`
instead — that is where Copilot looks, and nowhere else.

## Chat and keys

**Settings… → Claude** takes your Anthropic API key. Keys live in the **Windows
Credential Manager**, never on disk and never in the interface — the island can
only ask whether a key exists. Same for every integration key.

No telemetry. The only network requests Coucou makes are to the services you
configure yourself.

## Build it yourself

You need [Rust](https://rustup.rs), [Node 20+](https://nodejs.org), and the
**MSVC build tools** (Visual Studio Build Tools with "Desktop development with
C++"). WebView2 ships with Windows 10/11.

```powershell
cd windows
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # live-reloading development build
npm run pack           # builds the installer and drops it in windows/release/
```

`npm run dev` alone serves the front end in an ordinary browser, which is enough
to work on the island's looks. It also serves `dev/upload-preview.html`, which
replays the whole file-drop choreography on a loop — the one part of the UI that
otherwise needs a real drag from Explorer to see. Neither page ships in the app.

`npm run pack` leaves two files in `windows/release/`, the same names the release
workflow publishes:

```
Coucou-Windows-X.Y.Z-setup.exe    the versioned installer
Coucou-Windows-setup.exe          the same file under the rolling name
```

Installing is optional — `target/release/coucou.exe` runs on its own. There is no
window in the taskbar and no console: the island at the top of the screen and the
Mochi in the notification area are the whole app, and Quit lives in its menu.

The 28 sounds are the macOS app's own files; they are never duplicated in this
folder. The path is declared once, in `SOUNDS_DIR` at the top of
`vite.config.ts` — when they move to `shared/sounds/`, change that one line.

The app icon and the tray icon are drawn in code, like Mochi itself:

```powershell
npm run icons          # regenerates src-tauri/icons from scripts/gen-icons.mjs
```

### Layout

```
windows/
  src/                 island front end (TypeScript, no framework)
    mochi/             Mochi and the launch greeting, in Canvas 2D
    island/            state machine, hooks, integrations
    views/             every island view
    settings/          the settings window
  src-tauri/           Rust backend: window, named pipe, Claude API, pollers
  hook/                coucou-hook.exe, the Claude Code relay
  scripts/             icon generator
```

### Log

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Coucou\coucou.log` — hook events, permission decisions, poller
problems. It stays on your machine.

## What's different from the Mac version

- No notch, so the island lives at the top centre of the screen and retracts into
  the top edge instead of hiding in a notch.
- Permission approval works from **any** terminal; the Mac build only listens to
  VS Code sessions.
- Not in this version: sending a file by email, dragging Mochi onto a window to
  attach it as context, and jumping to a specific terminal window — "Open
  terminal" opens the working folder in VS Code when `code` is on your `PATH`.
- Cal.com shows the next bookings as a list rather than the Mac's calendar.

## Linux

The same app builds for Linux: everything that differs lives in
`src-tauri/src/platform/`, and the relay's transport in `hook/src/unix.rs`.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-layer-shell-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev patchelf \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # live-reloading development build
npm run pack           # AppImage, .deb and .rpm in windows/release/
```

### Install

```bash
sudo dpkg -i windows/release/Coucou-Linux-0.1.1-amd64.deb   # Debian, Ubuntu
sudo rpm -i windows/release/Coucou-Linux-0.1.1-x86_64.rpm   # Fedora
```

The `.deb` and `.rpm` depend on `libgtk-layer-shell0` / `gtk-layer-shell` and
`libayatana-appindicator3-1`; `apt` or `dnf` pulls them in, and the build step
above already needs the matching `-dev` packages.

The AppImage needs nothing installed at all:

```bash
chmod +x windows/release/Coucou-Linux-0.1.1-x86_64.AppImage
./windows/release/Coucou-Linux-0.1.1-x86_64.AppImage
```

First run on GNOME: the island sits just under the top bar, leaving the clock
and date visible. On KDE, Sway, Hyprland and COSMIC it sits at the very top edge,
over the panel — there is a real notch-equivalent there. `coucou.log` in
`~/.local/share/coucou/` records which path was taken, as `backend: …`.

What changes on Linux:

- **The island** is a gtk-layer-shell overlay anchored to the top edge on
  compositors that support it: COSMIC, KDE Plasma, Hyprland, Sway and other
  wlroots compositors. GNOME has no layer-shell, so there the island is a regular
  window placed by the window manager instead — see below.
  `COUCOU_LAYER_SHELL=0` forces that mode anywhere.
- **The GDK backend is chosen at startup** so the island actually reaches the
  top of the screen. A Wayland app has no say over where its window goes, so
  without layer-shell the island ended up centred vertically — mid-screen, and
  re-centred by the compositor on every resize. So: layer-shell available →
  Wayland; no layer-shell but an X server reachable → X11, where the window
  manager does honour the placement. GNOME sessions export
  `GDK_BACKEND=wayland` for every app they launch, so that value is overridden
  here. `COUCOU_GDK_BACKEND=x11|wayland` forces one, `GDK_BACKEND` is honoured as
  before. The choice is written to the log as `backend: …`.
- **The island sits just under the top panel**, not over it, unless it is a
  layer surface. With one (KDE Plasma, Sway, Hyprland, COSMIC and other wlroots
  compositors) the compositor anchors it to the very top edge, over the panel —
  the notch-like placement, and why the Mac layout is possible at all. Without
  one (GNOME, and anything else on X11) the island is an ordinary window and the
  top edge belongs to the clock and the date: drawn over it, the island hid both.
  So there it goes below the panel, at the depth reported by the window manager's
  own work area, not a hardcoded number. The island is never hinted as a dock:
  that would buy nothing now and, on window managers that honour dock struts
  (XFCE, MATE, Cinnamon, i3), would reserve desktop space for it.
- **Click-through** is the window's input region, kept equal to the island
  shape, so the compositor sends every other click to what is underneath.
- **Mochi's eyes** follow the pointer only while it is over the island: Wayland
  gives no app the cursor position anywhere else.
- **The island animates continuously while it is on screen**, exactly as on the
  Mac — it does not idle just because nothing is moving. Mochi's blinks, the
  status dots, the pill grid and the step ticker are all driven by wall-clock
  time rather than by a transition, so a loop that parked itself when it
  decided "nothing is animating" froze them all. Because Linux has no global
  cursor either, nothing would wake that loop again once the pointer left the
  island: on Windows the 60 Hz cursor poll kept re-arming it and hid the flaw.
  The loop now parks only once the island is hidden, which is what keeps it off
  the CPU when it is not on screen.
- **Claude Code hooks** go through `~/.local/share/coucou/bin/coucou-hook` and a
  Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/coucou.sock`. Both ends check that the other
  runs as the same user.
- **Keys** live in the Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet).
- **Files**: preferences in `~/.config/coucou/`, the log at
  `~/.local/share/coucou/coucou.log`.
- What the Windows build leaves out, this one does too: sending a file by
  email, dragging Mochi onto a window, and jumping to a specific terminal
  window — "Open terminal" opens the folder in VS Code.
